# AirBnB Clone Backend Documentation

Welcome to the `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` repository, which centralizes documentation for the **AirBnB Clone backend** project. This repository supports the development of a booking platform by providing detailed specifications, diagrams, and user stories for the backend system. The AirBnB Clone backend enables users to register, manage property listings, book accommodations, process payments, and more, with a focus on scalability, security, and reliability.

## Project Overview
The AirBnB Clone backend is a RESTful API system designed to replicate core functionalities of the AirBnB platform, including:
- User authentication and profile management.
- Property listing creation and management.
- Booking and payment processing.
- Reviews, notifications, and admin management.

This repository contains comprehensive documentation to guide implementation, including functional and technical requirements, data flows, workflows, and user interactions. It complements the `alx-airbnb-database` repository, which provides the database schema and sample data.

## Repository Purpose
The `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` repository serves as the primary source for backend documentation, offering:
- **Diagrams**: Visualizations of system features, data flows, and workflows.
- **User Stories**: Descriptions of user interactions with the system.
- **Requirement Specifications**: Detailed functional and technical requirements for key features.
- **Directory Structure**: Organized documentation for easy access and reference.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- **features-and-functionalities/**
  - `README.md`: Overview of the features and functionalities diagram.
  - `airbnb-backend-features.png`: Draw.io diagram detailing core functionalities (e.g., user authentication, booking system).
- **use-case-diagram/**
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the use case diagram.
  - `airbnb-use-case-diagram.png`: UML use case diagram visualizing interactions between actors (Guest, Host, Admin) and the system.
- **user-stories/**
  - `README.md`: Context for user stories.
  - `user-stories.md`: User stories derived from the use case diagram, describing key interactions (e.g., booking a property).
- **data-flow-diagram/**
  - `README.md`: Description of the data flow diagram.
  - `data-flow.png`: Level-1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) mapping data movement for core operations.
- **flowcharts/**
  - `README.md`: Overview of the flowchart.
  - `property-booking-flowchart.png`: Flowchart visualizing the property booking process workflow.
- **requirements.md**: Detailed functional and technical requirement specifications for user authentication, property management, and booking system.

## Getting Started
To explore the documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alx-airbnb-project-documentation.git
   cd alx-airbnb-project-documentation
   ```

2. **View Documentation**:
   - **Markdown Files**: Open `.md` files (e.g., `requirements.md`, `user-stories/user-stories.md`) in a text editor or Markdown viewer (e.g., VS Code, GitHub preview).
   - **Diagrams**: Open PNG files (e.g., `data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png`) in an image viewer (e.g., Preview on macOS, Photos on Windows).
   - **Edit Diagrams (Optional)**: Import Draw.io XML files (if saved) into [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to modify diagrams.

3. **Navigate Directories**:
   - Start with `requirements.md` for an overview of key features and API specifications.
   - Refer to `use-case-diagram/` for user-system interactions and `data-flow-diagram/` for data flows.
   - Check `flowcharts/` for detailed process workflows.

## Usage
This repository is intended for:
- **Developers**: Understand backend requirements and implement the API based on specifications in `requirements.md`.
- **Designers**: Reference diagrams (`use-case-diagram/`, `data-flow-diagram/`) to align frontend with backend functionality.
- **Stakeholders**: Review user stories (`user-stories/`) to ensure the system meets user needs.
- **Testers**: Use flowcharts (`flowcharts/`) and requirements to design test cases for backend processes.

## Notes
- **Scope**: This repository focuses on backend documentation. Frontend and deployment details are out of scope.
- **Tools**: Diagrams were created using Draw.io ([diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)).
- **Updates**: Additional diagrams or specifications may be added to cover other features (e.g., payments, notifications).
- **Dependencies**: The backend relies on PostgreSQL/MySQL, JWT authentication, and third-party services (e.g., Stripe, AWS S3).
